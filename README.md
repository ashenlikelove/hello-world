# hello-world
my first repository

I'm Valeria, friends call me Vale. I like new wave music; pizza with pumpkin, mushrooms and walnuts; Star Trek, The X-Files, and Rick & Morty; Saturday afternoons in Autumn; speaking in the dialect of my region, Emilia-Romagna; Robert Mitchum and Vincent Price; and of course, learning to code! 
I work in SEO, and in my free time I'm planning on starting my own magazine.
